## Project Brief:

- Data was taken from Kaggle.
- I have taken four classes for weather_classification i.e cloudy, rainy, shiny & sunrise.
- First I have done **Preprocessing (Resizing & Flattening)** of images.
- Used **Random Forest Classifier** for model training.
- Deployed the model using **Streamlit library**.
